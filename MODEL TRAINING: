MODEL TRAINING: 
1. The dataset, containing symptoms and corresponding diseases, is 
split into training and testing sets.  
2. Three machine learning models are trained:  
 Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) 
 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
 Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM 
3. Each model learns patterns between symptoms and diseases to 
make accurate predictions.  
4. Hyperparameters like learning rate, number of layers, and activation 
functions are adjusted to improve performance.
