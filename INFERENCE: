INFERENCE: 
• Machine learning can predict diseases based on symptom patterns 
with reasonable accuracy.  
• MLP is the most effective model for this dataset, achieving ~81% 
accuracy.  
• CNN is slightly less accurate (~80.5%) but computationally 
expensive, making it less practical for deployment.  
• RNN with LSTM is not suitable for this type of data, as it performed 
poorly (~2.25% accuracy).
