EVALUATION: 
1. Models are tested using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
2. MLP achieved the highest accuracy (~81%) and was selected as the 
final model.  
3. CNN achieved ~80.5% accuracy but required more computational 
power.  
4. RNN with LSTM performed poorly (~2.25% accuracy) and was not 
considered.  
5. The selected MLP model is deployed for real-time disease 
prediction.
